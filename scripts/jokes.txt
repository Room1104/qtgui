of vampires. I was charged with  shoplifting on three counts.

it in a library'. I thought  'That's a turn-up for the books.'
%%
And the back
of his anorak was leaping up and down, and people were chucking  money to him.
I  said  'Do  you  earn a  living  doing  that?'  He  said  'Yes,  this  is my
livelihood.'
%%
So I was getting into my car, and this bloke says to me "Can you
give me a lift?" I said "Sure, you look great, the world's your oyster, go for
it.'

said  'Knickerbocker  glory?' I said 'I do get a certain  amount of freedom in
these trousers, yes.'

He said "My dog's died.'

The one I was in went back and forwards. I thought 'This is unusual'.
And the dentist said to me 'Get out of the filing cabinet.'
%%
So I got home, and the phone was ringing. I picked it up,
and said 'Who's speaking please?' And a voice said 'You are.'
%%

time and said "You've been promoted again." And I swerved again.
He rang up a third time and said "You're managing director."
And I went into a tree. And a policeman came up and said
